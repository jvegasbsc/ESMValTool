IPCC AR5 Chapter 12
===================

Overview
--------

The goal of this effort is to code up routines to reproduce Chapter 12 of AR5 (Collins et al., 2013), so that the plots can be readily reproduced for ScenarioMIP simulations and compared to previous CMIP versions.

The main plot type which can be reproduced are maps of multi-model mean changes for annual or seasonal means over different scenarios and time periods with stippling and hatching indicating where the change is greater than two standard deviations of internal variability and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of the change (map_diff_mmm_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl and plot_map_diff_mmm_stipp_ipcc12.ncl). For the stippling to work the internal variability needs to be calculated from the piControl runs before the plotting using diagnostics IAV_for_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl (calculates and stores it for each individual model) or IAV_mmm_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl (calculates the multi-model mean variability for all given models). Either a multi-model mean based on whatever runs were included in IAV_mmm_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl can be used or the individual variabilities for the same models plotted can be used (in this case the mult-model mean is calculated in map_diff_mmm_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl using the corresponding models only). The optional diag_script_info attribute diag_script_info@iavmode (set to "each" for the latter) determines this behaviour, default if not given is that pre-calculated mult-model mean is used.

Very similar to above are the routines for zonal plots of 3D variables, zonal_cont_diff_mmm_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl and plot_zonal_cont_diff_mmm_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl. Again, for the stippling and hatching to work the internal variability needs to be precalculated using IAV_mmm_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl or IAV_for_stippandhatch_ipcc12.ncl. Very long control runs for high resolution can cause memory problems (e.g. MPI-ESM-MR 1000 year piControl, check available memory on your machine). In addition, this routine allows to plot a baseline field in contourlines (as e.g. in Figure 12.19 for wind).

Results from individual models can be plotted with map_diff_each_model_ipcc12.ncl (Figure 12.9).

Global (or regional) average timeseries (as e.g. Figure 12.5) can be calculated and plotted with ts_line_collins_ipcc_ch12.ncl and plot_ts_line_collins_ipcc_ch12.ncl.

Changes relative to global temperature change can be calculated with calc_map_diff_scaleT_mmm_stipp_ipcc12.ncl. Here significance is determined where mean change averaged over all realizations is larger than the 95% percentile of the distribution of models (as in Figure 12.10). plot_map_diff_mmm_stipp_ipcc12.ncl can also be used to plot these figures.

snw_area_seas_ipcc1232.ncl is used to calculate snow area extent changes. For this we need sftgif and sftlf from each included model. Either snw_area can be derived by using variable_defs/snw_area.ncl, in this case the variable in the namelist is snw_area and sftgif and sftlf need to be provided in the same folder structure as the other files (MIP = fx, ensemble = r0i0i0), or variable_defs/snw_area.ncl needs to be adapted accordingly. Alternatively snw can be used as variable in the namelist and then snow area is calculated within snw_area_seas_ipcc1232.ncl. In that case ESMValTool needs to be tricked into providing sftgif and sftlf as reformatted files in /work/climo, e.g. by calling MyDiag.ncl. The plotting can be done using plot_ts_line_collins_ipcc_ch12.ncl.
